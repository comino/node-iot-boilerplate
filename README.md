# Node-IoT-boilerplate
This is my personal boilerplate for new IoT prototypes and projects.
The goal is to have a swiss-army-knife as a starting point for any IoT application.
Furthermore here I can test (new) technologies in a non dangerous enviroment ;).

# Why ?
Most boilerplates and implementations neglect IoT specific issues.
Particularly the implementation of security can be tricky sometimes due to
device performance/memory limitations.

# Features / Planned features:
- Device and User auth based
- MongoDB connection with User and Device model
- HTTP, Websockets, MQTT sample implementations
- HTTPS incl. clientAuth

# Install & Run


```
npm install
npm start
```
